# UrlShortner

## Description
This is a URL shortner system, similar to bit.ly and tinyurl. The idea is to take a long url, and provide a shorter url which can easily be read or used in a tweet (which is limited to 140 characters).

## Goal
Writing this project to practice system design, code design, and dotnet core.
This project should be able to scale out easily if needed in order to meet demand.
